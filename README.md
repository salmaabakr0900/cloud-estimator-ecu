My Cloud Estimator Tool 
This is a professional web-based tool designed to calculate and estimate monthly infrastructure costs for major cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

What it Does
Resource Calculation: Estimates monthly costs based on vCPU cores, RAM (GB), and SSD Storage.

Provider Comparison: Allows users to switch between different providers to see how pricing varies.

Dynamic Breakdown: Provides a detailed cost breakdown for each resource type (Compute vs. Storage).

Fully Responsive: The interface is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Why I Built This
The primary goal was to bridge the gap between cloud architecture and financial planning. I wanted to understand the underlying pricing models of cloud giants and practice deploying a data-driven application using a modern CI/CD workflow with Firebase and GitHub.

The Tech Stack
Frontend: Built with semantic HTML5, custom CSS3 variables for a clean UI, and vanilla JavaScript for real-time calculations.

Database: Integrated with Firebase Firestore to log and store calculation history.

Deployment: Hosted via Firebase Hosting for high performance and reliability.

Version Control: Managed through GitHub to ensure code integrity and tracking.

Note: The pricing data used in this application is simulated for educational and demonstration purposes
