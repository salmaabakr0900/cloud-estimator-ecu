# My Cloud Estimator Tool ☁️

This is a simple web project I built to help calculate cloud costs for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. I customized the design to match my university's (ECU) colors.

### Why I built this?
The goal was to understand how cloud providers charge for resources like vCPU and RAM, and to practice deploying a real website using Firebase.

### What it does:
* Calculates monthly costs based on resources.
* Compares different providers.
* Full responsive design in ECU Red and Gold.

### Tools I used:
* HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend.
* Firebase for hosting.
* GitHub for version control.

*Note: Pricing data used is simulated for educational purposes.*
